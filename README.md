# Secure Password Validator

## What I Did
I built a Python tool to validate password strength based on common security criteria like length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Why I Did This Project
This project was designed to enhance my understanding of basic cybersecurity principles and Python string manipulation while creating a practical tool that can be integrated into other applications.

## What I Accomplished
- Developed a user-friendly password validation tool.
- Applied Python programming concepts like regex and conditional logic.
- Improved my understanding of security best practices.
